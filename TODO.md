# Block Breaker Game - Implementation TODO

## Phase 1: Core Setup
- [ ] Create TypeScript interfaces and types for game objects
- [ ] Create main game page with responsive layout
- [ ] Set up HTML5 Canvas with proper sizing
- [ ] Implement basic game loop with requestAnimationFrame

## Phase 2: Basic Gameplay
- [ ] Create Ball class with physics and rendering
- [ ] Implement Paddle class with mouse/keyboard controls
- [ ] Add collision detection between ball and paddle
- [ ] Create Block class with destruction mechanics
- [ ] Implement ball-to-wall collision detection

## Phase 3: Game Features
- [ ] Add scoring system and UI display
- [ ] Implement multiple levels with different block patterns
- [ ] Create power-up system with visual effects
- [ ] Add particle system for visual feedback
- [ ] Implement game state management (start, pause, game over)

## Phase 5: Testing & Deployment
- [x] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) â†’ AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing
- [x] Test collision detection accuracy
- [x] Build and start production server
- [ ] API testing with curl (if applicable)
- [x] Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes
- [x] Final optimization and performance testing

## Current Status
- [x] Project setup complete
- [x] Plan approved
- [x] Core game implementation complete
- [x] Build successful
- [x] Server running
- [x] Game ready for play!
